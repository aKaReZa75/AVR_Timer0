  This file provides a detailed description of Timer0 data and compare registers: `TCNT0`, `OCR0A`, and `OCR0B`. It explains how each register works, including bit-level information and their roles in compare match operations for Channel A and B.

---
## **TCNT0 (Timer/Counter Register)**

| Bit | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| 7-0 | TCNT0 (Timer/Counter Value) |

- **TCNT0**: The current value of the Timer/Counter. It increments with each clock cycle (or according to the prescaler).

---

## **OCR0A (Output Compare Register A)**

| Bit | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| 7-0 | OCR0A (Output Compare A Value) |

- **OCR0A**: Holds the value for the output compare match for Channel A. The timer will reset when TCNT0 matches OCR0A, triggering an interrupt if enabled.

---

## **OCR0B (Output Compare Register B)**

| Bit | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| 7-0 | OCR0B (Output Compare B Value) |

- **OCR0B**: Holds the value for the output compare match for Channel B. Similar to OCR0A but for Channel B.
